# CA New TSS Training

- **What is a CDA?**
	- ### Instructions from the broker to the closing company as to how to disburse the commission. ###
- **What are the most important details of a CDA?**
	1) ### The two most important details of a CDA are the escrow contacts email address and the breakdown. A CDA is primarily between the broker and the closing company. As a courtesy,  we always send a copy to the agent/TC and the Skyslope file. ###
- **What do we need to send a CDA?**
- **What do we verify before sending?**
- **What do we do if we cannot verify?**

The Commission Demand (CDA) for this transaction was sent to title/escrow based on the information provided to us in the Commission tab in Skyslope.
			
However, we were not able to confirm the gross commission/sale price amount because
		
--- the MLS Listing Detail page has not been uploaded to your Skyslope Checklist. Please note: if you have agreed to a Gross Commission that is different from what is noted in the MLS, please upload a fully-executed CAR CBC - Cooperating Broker Compensation Agreement to the checklist.
		
--- the sale price in the RPA does not match what is noted in the commission tab. If the sale price was renegotiated from what is in the RPA, please upload the fully-executed counter-offer(s) and/or addendums.
		
If a broker signature is needed, please use an e-signature program, and send to Debbie Penny 01878277 at ca.sign@exprealty.net.

We are working diligently on getting a Commission Distribution Authorization out on your behalf to the closing company for this transaction.

However,

--- there are no documents in your Skyslope file and we at least need a fully-executed Purchase Agreement if you are representing the Buyer and a Purchase Agreement and a Listing Agreement if you are representing the Seller in order to do so.

--- 

After SkySlope is updated, submit a CDA request with the property address in the subject line as it appears in SkySlope to ca.transactions@exprealty.net .
