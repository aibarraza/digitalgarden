## CDA
---
### What is a CDA?
- **Instructions from the broker to the closing company as to how to disburse the commission.**
---
### What are the most important details of a CDA?
- **The two most important details of a CDA are the escrow contact's email address and the breakdown. A CDA is between the broker and the closing company and as a courtesy, we always send a copy to the agent, their TC and the Skyslope file.** 
---
### What do we need to send a CDA?
- **At a minimum, we need a Sale Price and Commission in the Skyslope Commission tab, and an RPA if we are representing the Buyer and an RPA and an RLA if we are representing the Seller. See No CDA Template below. If the RPA/RLA does not have eXp Realty as a broker to the transaction we request that CCS review the doc before sending the CDA. If they've already reviewed it and reached out to the agent, that is acceptable for our purposes.**
---
### How may points of verification do we review in the Verify DA screen in TRX?
**3 points.**
1. **Credit/Concession** 
2.  **Valid escrow/title email address**
3.  **Split-check or single-check ** 
---
### In CA, when do we do the Initial Review and when do we Send First DA?
- **We do both of these tasks at the same time.**
---
### What details do we review before sending a CDA during our Initial Review?
- **INITIAL REVIEW**
- **PP - $500,000 as per RPA**
- **Commission - 2.5%**
- **COE - 5/1/22**
- **Split - none**
- **TC Fee - none**
- **Referral - none**
- **Concession - none**
- **Personal Deal - no**
- **Additional Notes - **
---
###  What do we need to verify and where? What do we do if we cannot verify?
1. **The purchase price in the RPA, counters, addendums or Request for Repairs**
2. **The commission amount in the MLS or in a Commission or Buyer's Representation Agreements**
	
- **If we cannot verify, we always send the CDA based on the information that was provided to us in the Commission tab. However, if we cannot verify, we follow it up with the No Verification Template below to the agent and escrow.**
---
#### No Verification Template
```
The Commission Demand (CDA) for this transaction was sent to title/escrow on your behalf based on the information provided to us in the Commission tab in Skyslope.

However, --- 

--- the MLS Listing Detail page has not been uploaded to your Skyslope Checklist so we are unable to verify the gross commission. Please note: if you have agreed to a Gross Commission that is different from what is noted in the MLS, please upload a fully-executed CAR CBC - Cooperating Broker Compensation Agreement to the checklist.

--- the sale price in the RPA does not match what is noted in the commission tab. If the sale price was renegotiated from what is in the RPA, please upload the fully executed counter-offer(s) or addendums.


```
---
#### No CDA Template
```
We are working diligently on sending out a Commission Disbursement Authorization on your behalf to the closing company for this transaction.

However, ---

--- there are no documents in your Skyslope file and we at least need a fully-executed Purchase Agreement if you are representing the Buyer and a Purchase Agreement and a Listing Agreement if you are representing the Seller in order to do so. Please upload to Skyslope and reply here and we can send out the CDA ASAP.

If this transaction has CANCELLED, please cancel in Skyslope and upload cancellation docs. 

--- we are in need of a valid escrow contact email address in Skyslope in order to do so. Please update Skyslope and reply here and we can send out the CDA ASAP. 

--- the Commission Reduction Request form is required before a credits/concessions can be added to a CDA. See attached and send to Debbie Panny using an e-sign program to ca.sign@exprealty.net. Please upload to Skyslope and reply here and we can send out the CDA ASAP.  

**** we are in need of a w9 dated in 2022 and a fully-executed Referral Agreement in order to add the referral fee to the demand. Please upload to Skyslope and reply here and we can send out the CDA ASAP.

**** we are in need of commission split information between/among the agents. Please update the Skyslope commission tab with the percentage of gross that each agent will be receiving and reply here and we can get the CDA out ASAP.

If a broker signature is needed, please use an e-sign program, and send to Debbie Penny 01878277 at ca.sign@exprealty.net.

```

****Sending a Single-check CDA at TSS discretion is an option if close to COE for these two options only.***

---
#### Single-check Template
```
In the interest of time a Single-check Commission Demand (CDA) for this transaction was sent to title/escrow on your behalf.

--- We sent this because we are approaching the COE and are still in need of the previously requested Referral Documents. 

Once eXp receives a copy of the check and the referral documents in Skyslope, eXp will disburse to our agents through their direct deposit accounts and mail the referral brokerage's fee.

TCs will need to be paid directly outside of escrow.

```
---
### When do we send a Single-Check CDA?

1.  **When an agent’s name in Skyslope is noted with “Single-Check”**
    
2.  **When an agent/TC requests one.**
    
3.  **When there is a [Garnishment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H2h5CgHqKdBsozGbsbNCaser_3nSsDM6NAa1aaJCvuI/edit#heading=h.iaqhq7n0vxlx) in the CFB added by Accounting. Please note: if there are multiple agents in the file, we only need the agent with the garnishment’s funds to come to eXp, split is ok for the others.**
    
4.  **When there is a [Commission Advance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H2h5CgHqKdBsozGbsbNCaser_3nSsDM6NAa1aaJCvuI/edit#heading=h.3iyen2tt2zvz) in the file added by Management. Please note: if there are multiple agents in the file, we only need the agent with the commission advance’s funds to come to eXp, split is ok for the others.**
    
5.  **When a transaction is an [Express Offer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H2h5CgHqKdBsozGbsbNCaser_3nSsDM6NAa1aaJCvuI/edit#heading=h.sskxcpmwkwru). Please note: There should be a bonus in the file and two outgoing referrals added by Management.**
    
6.  **When you decide to send a single-check CDA because you are waiting on split info or referral docs.**
    
	****Please note: sending a single-check CDA when you are waiting for credit/concession docs does not help us here. Please do not send a CDA in those situations until you receive the [CRR](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17lYLzF8YK7HZndaMLJvnN_vAr8LV7h3I/view?usp=sharing).***
---
### If our agent is representing both sides, what do we need in the SS file before sending the CDA?
- **Like mentioned above, we need a fully-executed RPA AND a fully-executed RLA. Sometimes, agents incorrectly only create a sale transaction instead of a listing first. In this case, we stop everything and contact CCS so that they can request Listing Documentation and set the file to Under Dispute.**
---
### What do we do if a SS file is Under Dispute?
- **We do not do anything without CCS direction. We can request in the TSS/CCS chat that CCS review to make sure it is still Under Dispute.**
---
### What is the Skyslope e-mail address for?
- **It’s an email created for all transactions that delivers any email attachment to the Documents tab in SS. We include the SS email as a contact in all TRX files and always include it with all email correspondence.** 
---
### Why is completing Pending Close so important?
- **Reviewing PC every day ensures that we don’t miss a new note in SS or more importantly, it prevents us from letting a transaction reach the COE without a CDA.** 
—-
### What is a PCC?
**A Post-Close Correction is our method for correcting settled transactions only if the correction requires a change to the CFB.** 
—-
### Who do we blame?
- **We are a team, and we all make mistakes. Too many mistakes and PCCs make our team look bad. Too many mistakes of the same kind, make you look bad. Remember, we do not assume anything and we try our best to only send CDAs with the information provided to us in Skyslope or Zoho. When in doubt, reach out. If we do not verify, miss a note or are not caught up in our Pending Closes, it's our fault. Always try to either send a CDA, or note the file with the reason it's not out yet.**
---
## TRX
---
### What's the difference between TRX and the WQ?
- **TRX is a database of all the transactions in SS.**
- **WQ is a database of tasks that are automatically created for every transaction in TRX.**
- **Four main WQ tasks** 
	- ***Initial Review***
	- ***Send First DA***
	- ***Pending Close (Sent Back)***
	- ***Settlement***
---
#### Dual-agency Missing Listing Docs Template
```
Hello, 

We are in need of Listing Documentation for this transaction. 

It looks as if you incorrectly created a Sale transaction in Skyslope before creating the Listing file. Listings in Skyslope are a two-step process. 

First, the listing is created and the listing documents are uploaded and approved by the compliance team. Once the seller accepts a contract, the listing file is converted into a sale file and all documents, listing and sale, are in the same checklist. 

We need you to create a listing file in Skyslope and upload the listing docs. Once that’s done, let us know here and we can get the Skyslope support team to merge both of your files so that we can have all documentation in one place. 

PLEASE NOTE: we are not able to send a Commission Demand to the closing company or settle for disbursement without both listing and sales documentation. Your file will remain "on hold" until this is corrected. 

Hope this helps,
```
---
### What's the difference between a TRX#, a Skyslope Transaction ID, Zoho#?
- **TRX numbers ends in .1, .2, .3, etc. It’s our way of pairing TCD checks from transactions with CDAs to their TRX file.** 
- **SkySlope Transaction IDs are found in the Details tab in TRX and in the View Source code in SS. It’s what we use to verify when we withdraw a file in TRX.** 
- **A Zoho# allows us internally to review trouble tickets by sharing with your leads.** 
---
### How do we withdraw a file in TRX?
1. **Copy Cancellation note in SS log to TRX notes.**
2. **Verify Skyslope Transaction ID in source code.**
3. **Withdraw in TRX.**
---
## CREDITS
---
### What's the difference between a Credit, and a Commission Reduction?
- **A Credit is one-sided, a Commission Reduction requires both sides to agree.** 
---
### What documentation do we require for a Commission Reductions?
- **If our agent is representing the buyer, we need a CBC - Cooperating Broker Compensation Agreement to change the commission from what is on the MLS**
- **If our agent is representing the seller, we need an MT - Modification of Listing Terms to amend the commission noted in the RLA.**
---
### What documentation do we require for  a Credit?
- **We always need a Commission Reduction Request ([CRR](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17lYLzF8YK7HZndaMLJvnN_vAr8LV7h3I/view?usp=sharing)) form to add a credit the the CDA.**
	- **Remember, never send a Single-check CDA if you are awaiting a [CRR](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17lYLzF8YK7HZndaMLJvnN_vAr8LV7h3I/view?usp=sharing)
---
## PERSONAL TRANSACTIONS
---
### What are Personal Transactions and how do we treat them?
- **A Personal Transaction is defined as a transaction in which our agent and/or their spouse (or an entity they belong to) are on contract or on title. **
	- ***NOTE: if an agent purchases in another state and is receiving a referral fee from that state's agent, we treat the referral fee as a Personal Transaction.***
---
### How do we verify a Personal Transaction?
#### Personal Transaction Verification Template
```
This transaction is noted as a Personal Transaction in SkySlope. 

Please confirm that this is indeed a Personal Transaction and we’ll get a CDA out to you ASAP.

At eXp, we allow 3 Personal transactions a year. A Personal Transaction is defined as a transaction in which you and/or your spouse (or an entity you belong to) are on contract or on title.  

If this is the case, your commission would not be subject to the 80/20 split but only a $250 transaction fee + $25 Broker Review Fee + $40 Risk Management fee to cover E&O Insurance for a total of $315.00 to be paid to eXp Realty at the COE. Please note, capped agents yield no benefit from Personal Transactions.

Please advise,
```
---
### Do we handle Personal Transactions differently if our agent is the Buyer or the Seller? 
- **If they are the buyer, we write the CDA for the gross commission that is noted in the MLS and treat it as a capped transaction. If the agent is crediting some or all of their portion of the commission to the seller, we require a [CRR](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17lYLzF8YK7HZndaMLJvnN_vAr8LV7h3I/view?usp=sharing).**
- **If they are the seller, we request that they amend the Listing Agreement to $315 plus TC fee if any.**
---
### How do we handle Personal Transactions if the agent has a Mentor?
- **We automatically remove the Mentor Program Fee. The Mentor Fee is optional and we only remove it once we receive the [Mentor Waiver form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14eNNdGqdmeCanss-tQUF65XtGqu4v1kW/view?usp=sharing)**.
---
### When do we remove stock in TRX?
1. **When a lead/manager removes it for any reason.
2. **When an agent is taking no commission and is only paying eXp fees and a TC fee.
---
## REFERRALS / BPO - [RRBPO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qGbZvsPdfA9ncW8_fMr7lC4GaIu_y1BOxXlgtevjGWM/edit)
---
### What is the difference between and Outgoing Referral and an Incoming Referral Fee?
- **An Outgoing Referral is the client that our agent is sending to another agent. Subsequently, our agent is now expecting an Incoming Referral Fee.**
---
### How much are Opcity Referral fees? 
**![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tUHwjcwMO75Gj5Jxg5cfX3F_Rdc9Vr57mKsFySjH7e6gqclg4TBxA4KfwzAYXkvdtvSK4dz7Zf3CqM9XvCJy8Nt5LqzCFE2k7h520cPEYzUvGU7zNPcn7BYk766XUaD6ydz_dCVQ)**

---
### What do we do before sending a CDA with an Opcity referral noted in the Commission tab.
- **We request that a lead upload a copy of the [Opcity Referral Agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cz0zLJb_177uHSTCMRIeMkzr_BXVJpnL/view?usp=sharing) to the Skyslope file so that we can verify the referral fee amount.**
---
### Are referral fees calculated as a percentage of gross commission before concessions or commission after concessions?
- **As of this writing, only Opcity and Zillow referral fees are calculated as a percentage of gross commission before concessions.
---
### What fees do we charge on a referral?
- **Only Broker Review if the agent is not capped, and Broker Review and Capped Transaction Fee if capped.**
---
### What is Implied Agency?
- **In a New Construction transactions, whether we choose Representation Type Other or Purchase, depends on whether or not our agent holds agency with the Buyer.  Implied Agency refers to the idea that even if there may not be a document confirming the agency relationship, it may be implied. If it is, we can hold agency.** 
---
### How do we review New Construction referrals?
- **To make things easier for TSS because builder documents vary, if eXp or our agent is anywhere in the Purchase Agreement, we assume we hold Implied Agency and switch the file to Purchase and charge a Risk Management Fee and send a Split-check CDA.**

- **If we do not receive Purchase Documents OR eXp and/or our agent are not noted in them, OR eXp and/or our agent are only noted in Registration Documents, we treat this file as a referral, remove RM and we send our w9 to the closing company.**
#### New Construction Referral Template
```
Your file is a New Construction Referral. On referrals, eXp and you are not on contract and do not hold an agency relationship with the buyer.

We only send CDAs on files were eXp and you are on contract and have agency with a party to the sale.

Typically, in referrals, the gross commission is sent to eXp and we disburse through your direct-deposit account.

Attached is our w9 which notes the address where the closing company should send the commission check.

If you provide a copy of the check in Skyslope, we can pay out based on the copy and don't have to wait for the actual check to arrive in our bank's lockbox.

Hope this helps,
```

## LEASES
---

---
## MINIMUM COMMISSION
---
### What is the Minimum Commission Rule?
- **The Minimum Commission Rule has two parts.**
1. **The first part applies to Listings. All listings with a sale price of over $83,333 have a minimum commission of $565. $500 Company Commission, $40 RM Fee, $25 BR Fee. As of this writing, minimum commission on the Buyer side is applied purely at broker discretion.**
2. **The second part applies to listing transactions where the sale price is below $83,333, in this case, depending on how much commission the agent is receiving, the Minimum Commission varies.** 
	- **If the agent is receiving less than 3% in gross commission, eXp's portion will be 20% of 3% of gross commission.** 
	- **If the agent is receiving 3% or more in gross commission, eXp's portion will be 20% of gross commission.**
